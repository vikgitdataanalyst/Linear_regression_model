# Linear_regression_model
Hey! connections.
I loaded the random csv file 'data.csv' that have two rows , one is input and another is output, tried to split the data into training and testing phase.
And after that fit the testing inputs in model to get  our testing output based on that training inputs and outputs.

I took help of Python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.model_selection 
So let's dive in....
