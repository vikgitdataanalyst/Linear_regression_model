# Linear_regression_model
Hey! connections.
I took help of Python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.model_selection 

I loaded the random csv file 'data.csv' that have two rows , one is input and another is output, tried to split the data into training and testing phase.
And after that fit the testing inputs in model to get  our testing output based on that training inputs and outputs.

And using matplotlib i fitted as best fit line for traing and testing data. 

So let's dive in....
